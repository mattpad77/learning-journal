## **Version Control**
> By using a Version Control System you can revist previous versions of a file oe set of files by recording changes.

### **Centralized Version Control**
> A centralized server that can be accessed by various clients for the purpose of developer collaboration. In all, this eliminates the need for all local databases consolidating into one single server.

### **Distributed Version Control**
> The DVC is merely a back up of your repositories in the case of a CVS failure or catastrophic loss. The DVC allows for multiple mirrored repositories.
