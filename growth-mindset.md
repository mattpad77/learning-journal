# Growth Mindset In My Own Words

  To me a growth mindset means to embrace perserverance and to have a love for learning. Thus inquiring that success does not only come from inherent traits such as intelligence and drive.

## Three Reminders To Stay in The Growth Mindset

* Pursue topics and ideas that ive been interested in for a long time or that get me out of my comfort zone.
* Surround yourself with likeminded individuals who are also aspiring for success and who are looking to grow and learn along the way.
* Continue to take put in the same amount of effort into every challenge you tackle.
