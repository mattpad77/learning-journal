# HTML Notes

## Div
> Web developers use the div element to group together related elements. Developers use the class or id elements to indicate the role of the div element.

## Header's & Footer's
> The main two areas on the top and bottom of the page. The header usually contains the logo, main, and nav. The Footer usually contains copyright information and can also contain a seperate nav.

## Navigation
> Contains the main navigational bar for the website. A navigation bar in HTML5 can be in the header and the footer. 

## Articles
> An article element acts as a container for a part of the page you want isolated or any individual piece of content. Article elements can be nested inside of each other. 

## Asides
> This element has two purposes depending on whether or not it is inside the article or not. A glossary or pullquote would be used inside the article element. If outside the element it acts as a container for the content that is related to the entire page. Such as a list of recent posts, a search box, or recent tweets.
